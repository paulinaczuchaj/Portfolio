# About me 
My name is Paulina Czuchaj. I am a Master of Science in Biotechnology, but in one of my previous jobs I dealt with testing as an additional task. From that moment my interest in testing started. Currently I am working as a software tester in GIS Support company in Lublin. At the moment my main focus is automation. Recently I received Santander scholarship for SQL course and in my free time I am preparing for ISTQB exam.
